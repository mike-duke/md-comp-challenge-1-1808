# md-comp-challenge-1-1808

For this comp, i have chosen a hypothetical site for a hypothetical youTube channel about making old recipes from old recipe books from the middle of the previous century. It's an idea that's been kicking around in my brain for a while now, which i may never do anything with, but it seemed like a good theme for a comp. Here would be a link to videos, contact info, social media, etc.
